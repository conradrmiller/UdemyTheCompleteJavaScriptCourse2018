/*
Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is calculated using the formula: BMI = mass / height^2 = mass / (height * height). (mass in kg and height in meters).

1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
2. Calculate both their BMIs
3. Create a boolean vaiable containing information about whether Mark has a highter BMI than John. 
4. Print a string to the console containing the variable from step 3. (Something like "Is Mark's BMI higher than John's? true").

var massMark, massJohn, heightMark, heightJohn;

massMark = 95;
massJohn = 100;
heightMark = 1.8;
heightJohn = 1.5;

var bmiMark, bmiJohn;
bmiMark = massMark / (heightMark * heightMark);
bmiJohn = massJohn / (heightJohn * heightJohn);
console.log(bmiMark, bmiJohn);
var isMarkBmiHigher;
isMarkBmiHigher = bmiMark > bmiJohn;

console.log('Is Marks BMI higher than Johns?' + isMarkBmiHigher);
